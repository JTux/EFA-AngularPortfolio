		<p>Having been around for a while now and having had my hands in a lot of cohorts, I have seen some incredible
			students come through the program. I've also had the pleasure of teaching some of the people that would go
			on to be some of our wonderful instructors. Below are just a few reviews left by former students and
			coworkers.</p>
		<p>
			With my most recent class coming to completion with over 20 graduates, I have seen quite a few success
			stories. Whether that be students completely rocking tech assessments or it be one of the many students
			landing jobs before graduation, I've been fortunate enough to work with some amazingly dedicated people.
			It's been quite an amazing journey so far.

			<p class="quote">Josh was my .NET instructor at Eleven Fifty Academy and part of the reason I am pursuing to
				be an instructor there myself. His passion for learning is apparent the moment you meet him. I leave
				every interaction with Josh feeling like I have learned something new. The cool part is that it isnâ€™t
				always about code. Josh takes the time to explain as many times as you may need to help you understand,
				and he never makes you feel bad for not getting it right away. That might be one of my favorite things
				about him. Now as his coworker I get to see first hand all the hard work he puts into his classes. You
				would be hardpressed to find someone more dedicated and passionate. I aspire to be as good as an
				instructor as him one day.

				took his time to walk through examples, and always made time for questions. He has a real knack for
				making complex concepts simpler and easier to understand. His lessons seemed very well-prepared and
				organized.
